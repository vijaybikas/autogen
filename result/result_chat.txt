I can provide you with a high-level design, architecture, and recommendations for your Tesla stock price prediction software.

**Software Design:**

1. **Data Collection:** The software should collect the current Tesla stock prices from reliable sources such as Yahoo Finance or Quandl.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The collected data should be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other errors.
3. **Machine Learning Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet) should be trained to predict the future stock prices based on historical data.
4. **Prediction:** The trained model will make predictions for the next 5 years.

**Architecture:**

1. **Frontend:** Use a web framework such as React or Angular to create a user-friendly interface for users to input the current Tesla stock price and view the predicted prices over time.
2. **Backend:** Use a server-side language like Node.js, Python, or Ruby to handle API requests from the frontend and store the historical data in a database (e.g., MongoDB).
3. **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy the backend on a cloud platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, using services like Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Microsoft Azure Functions.

**User Interface:**

1. **Dashboard:** Create a dashboard with interactive charts and graphs to display the predicted stock prices over time.
2. **Input Form:** Design an input form for users to enter the current Tesla stock price, allowing them to easily access the software.
3. **Alert System:** Implement an alert system that notifies users when their predicted stock price is close to a historical high or low.

**Cloud Deployment:**

1. **Containerization:** Use containerization tools like Docker to package the backend API and its dependencies into a single image.
2. **Serverless Architecture:** Consider using a serverless architecture with AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions to handle API requests and store data in a database.

**Cost:**

1. **Backend Services:** Estimate costs for backend services such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, or MongoDB.
2. **Cloud Provider Fees:** Calculate fees for cloud provider services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
3. **Machine Learning Model Training:** Estimate costs for machine learning model training and deployment on a cloud platform.
4. **API Gateway and Security:** Estimate costs for API gateway and security features such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

**Example Code:**

Here's an example of how you could structure the software using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB:
```javascript
// models/stock.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const stockSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  symbol: String,
  currentPrice: Number
});

const Stock = mongoose.model('Stock', stockSchema);

module.exports = Stock;
```

```javascript
// controllers/stockController.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Stock = require('../models/stock');

router.get('/predict', async (req, res) => {
  const currentPrice = req.query.currentPrice;
  const stock = await Stock.findOne({ symbol: 'TSLA' });
  if (!stock) {
    return res.status(404).send('Stock not found');
  }
  const predictedPrices = await predictFutureStockPrices(currentPrice);
  return res.send(predictedPrices);
});

module.exports = router;
```

```javascript
// models/futureStockPrices.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const futureStockPricesSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  symbol: String,
  predictedPrice: Number
});

const FutureStockPrices = mongoose.model('FutureStockPrices', futureStockPricesSchema);

module.exports = FutureStockPrices;
```

This is a high-level design and architecture, and you can modify it to suit your specific needs. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

I can provide guidance on designing, coding, user interface, cloud deployment, and cost of the software.

**Designing the Software:**

Based on the high-level design provided earlier, I recommend the following:

1. **Frontend:** Use a web framework like React or Angular to create a user-friendly interface for users to input the current Tesla stock price and view the predicted prices over time.
2. **Backend:** Use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to handle API requests from the frontend and store historical data in a database (e.g., MongoDB).
3. **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy the backend on AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions using serverless architecture.

**Coding the Software:**

Here's an example of how you could structure the software using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB:
```javascript
// models/stock.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const stockSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  symbol: String,
  currentPrice: Number
});

const Stock = mongoose.model('Stock', stockSchema);

module.exports = Stock;
```

```javascript
// controllers/stockController.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Stock = require('../models/stock');

router.get('/predict', async (req, res) => {
  const currentPrice = req.query.currentPrice;
  const stock = await Stock.findOne({ symbol: 'TSLA' });
  if (!stock) {
    return res.status(404).send('Stock not found');
  }
  const predictedPrices = await predictFutureStockPrices(currentPrice);
  return res.send(predictedPrices);
});

module.exports = router;
```

```javascript
// models/futureStockPrices.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const futureStockPricesSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  symbol: String,
  predictedPrice: Number
});

const FutureStockPrices = mongoose.model('FutureStockPrices', futureStockPricesSchema);

module.exports = FutureStockPrices;
```

```javascript
// services/stockService.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Stock = require('../models/stock');

async function predictFutureStockPrices(currentPrice) {
  // Use a machine learning model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
  const prediction = await makePrediction(currentPrice);
  return { predictedPrice: prediction };
}

module.exports = predictFutureStockPrices;
```

```javascript
// utils/makePrediction.js
const df = require('../data/stockData.json');
const mlModel = require('./mlModel');

async function makePrediction(currentPrice) {
  const predictions = await mlModel.predict(currentPrice);
  return predictions;
}
```

**User Interface:**

Here's an example of how you could create a user interface using React:
```jsx
// components/StockComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const StockComponent = () => {
  const [currentPrice, setCurrentPrice] = useState('');
  const [predictedPrices, setPredictedPrices] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/predict', { method: 'GET' })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setPredictedPrices(data));
  }, []);

  const handleInputChange = (event) => {
    setCurrentPrice(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={currentPrice} onChange={handleInputChange} />
      <button onClick={() => fetch('/predict').then(response => response.json())}>
        Predict Future Stock Prices
      </button>
      <ul>
        {predictedPrices.map((price, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{price.predictedPrice}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default StockComponent;
```

**Cloud Deployment:**

Here's an example of how you could deploy the backend on AWS Lambda:
```javascript
// lambda/stock-lambda.js
const aws = require('aws-sdk');

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const { currentPrice } = event;
  const stock = await Stock.findOne({ symbol: 'TSLA' });
  if (!stock) {
    return {
      statusCode: 404,
      body: 'Stock not found',
    };
  }
  const predictedPrices = await predictFutureStockPrices(currentPrice);
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(predictedPrices),
  };
};
```

**Cost:**

Here's an example of how you could estimate the costs for the backend services:
```javascript
// cost/lambda-cost.js
const aws = require('aws-sdk');

exports.handler = async () => {
  const lambda = new aws.Lambda({
    region: 'us-east-1',
    functionName: 'stock-lambda',
  });
  const response = await lambda.invoke({
    FunctionName: 'stock-lambda',
    InvocationType: 'RequestResponse',
    Payload: JSON.stringify({ currentPrice }),
  });
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(response),
  };
};
```

**Note:** This is just an example of how you could structure the software and deploy it on AWS Lambda. You may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case.

**Example Use Case:**

Here's an example of how you could use the software:
```javascript
// main.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const stockService = require('./services/stockService');

app.get('/predict', (req, res) => {
  const currentPrice = req.query.currentPrice;
  stockService.predictFutureStockPrices(currentPrice)
    .then((predictedPrices) => {
      res.json(predictedPrices);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error predicting future stock prices' });
    });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

This is just a basic example of how you could structure the software and deploy it on AWS Lambda. You may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

**Example Use Case**

A user wants to retrieve historical stock price data for Tesla. They send a GET request to the API Gateway Service with the following parameters:

* `api-key`: their API key
* `timestamp`: the current timestamp

The API Gateway Service will receive the request and forward it to the Data Ingestion Service, which will process the request and retrieve the historical stock price data from Amazon S3. The Data Ingestion Service will then pass the data to the Machine Learning Model Service, which will make predictions based on the input data.

The Machine Learning Model Service will return a response with the predicted stock prices for Tesla at the specified timestamp. The API Gateway Service will forward this response back to the user, who can view the predicted stock prices in real-time.

Based on the refined software design plan, I've estimated the total cost of ownership for the proposed system.

**Hardware Costs**

* **AWS Lambda**: 10,000 requests per month x $100/month = $1,000/month
* **Amazon S3**: 10,000 GB-months x $0.023/GB-month = $230/month
* **Amazon DynamoDB**: 10,000 GB-months x $0.02/GB-month = $200/month

Total hardware cost: $1,430/month

**Software Costs**

* **AWS Lambda**: 10,000 requests per month x $100/month = $1,000/month (Node.js backend framework)
* **Amazon S3**: 10,000 GB-months x $0.023/GB-month = $230/month
* **Amazon DynamoDB**: 10,000 GB-months x $0.02/GB-month = $200/month

Total software cost: $1,460/month

**Cloud Service Costs**

* **AWS Lambda**: $100/month (for 10,000 requests per month)
* **Amazon S3**: $230/month
* **Amazon DynamoDB**: $200/month

Total cloud service cost: $530/month

**Total Estimated Cost**

Hardware costs: $1,430/month
Software costs: $1,460/month
Cloud service costs: $530/month
Total estimated cost: $4,110/month

**Annualized Costs**

* **Hardware costs**: $4,110/month x 12 = $49,220/year
* **Software costs**: $4,110/month x 12 = $49,220/year
* **Cloud service costs**: $530/month x 12 = $6,360/year
* **Total estimated annual cost**: $60,480/year

**Additional Costs**

* **Data storage and processing**: $10,000/year (estimated)
* **Machine learning model maintenance**: $5,000/year (estimated)

**Total Estimated Cost per Year**

$49,220/year (hardware) + $4,110/year (software) + $6,360/year (cloud service) = $59,480/year

**Break-Even Analysis**

To determine the break-even point, we can calculate when the total estimated annual cost equals the total hardware and software costs.

* **Hardware and software costs**: $49,220/year
* **Cloud service costs**: $6,360/year (assuming 10,000 requests per month)
* **Data storage and processing**: $10,000/year (estimated)

Total estimated annual cost: $65,580/year

To break even, we need to cover the total estimated annual cost of $65,580.

* **Hardware and software costs**: $49,220/year
* **Cloud service costs**: $6,360/year
* **Data storage and processing**: $10,000/year (estimated)

Total estimated annual cost: $65,580

Since we already have the total estimated annual cost of $60,480, which is less than the break-even point, we can conclude that the proposed system will not break even.

**Conclusion**

The estimated costs for the proposed system are:

* **Hardware**: $1,430/month x 12 = $16,880/year
* **Software**: $1,460/month x 12 = $17,440/year
* **Cloud service**: $530/month x 12 = $6,360/year

Total estimated annual cost: $40,660/year

The additional costs for data storage and processing are estimated to be $10,000/year.

**Recommendations**

Based on the estimates, it appears that the proposed system will not break even. However, we can still consider the following recommendations:

* **Optimize hardware and software usage**: Monitor system performance and optimize hardware and software usage to reduce costs.
* **Implement data storage and processing solutions**: Consider using cloud-based data storage and processing services to reduce costs.
* **Negotiate with AWS and other providers**: Negotiate with AWS and other providers to secure better pricing for the proposed system.

Please note that these estimates are based on the provided information and may vary depending on various factors, such as usage patterns, data volumes, and specific requirements.
